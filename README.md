# Consistent-Cups-Espresso-Accessories
Open Source DIY solution to create Bluetooth-compatible pressure sensor and scale to use with a manual espresso machine. 

_**Project Background and Introduction**_

The market for espresso machines is a vastly large and competitive one. Every individual has their own preferences and lifestyles which result in the need for different machines. There are so many methods for making espresso that vary significantly in user effort, time, and price. 

**Semi-Automatic Espresso Machines**

Automatic machines require little user effort and time for extracting an espresso shot. However, the large downside to these machines is that, generally speaking, they cost upwards of $300-400 depending on the additional features and components they have. Once the grinds are tamped in the portafilter, the machine automatically applies the pressure for the duration of time that can sometimes be specified by the user.

**Manual Espresso Machines**

Manual espresso machines require a significant amount of preparation, time, and effort. These machines are generally cheaper than their automatic counterparts, being found for upwards of $100. For these machines, once the grinds are tamped in the portafilter, the user must also heat their water to the desired temperature. The user then needs a scale underneath the cup to be able to see how fast they are extracting the espresso. After pulling the lever and applying pressure for a set amount of time, the extraction is finally complete. The downsides to this machine are the extensive clean-up time, and the loss of water temperature during the extraction. However, this machine allows the user to have complete control over the amount of pressure and time variables for making their own ideal cup of espresso, perfect for the connoisseurs. With the pressure transducer and scale, it would be even easier to repeat their results or tweak it to their preferences. An example of what this type of machine looks like is in the right image of Figure 3. 

 

Besides the bean and how it's roasted, a good cup of lever espresso relies on three main factors: Pressure, temperature, and speed of the pull.  The speed of pull is determined by the grind size of the bean and the pressure.  Pressure is controlled by pulling the machine's handle.  A monitor system lets you track and save the pressure and pull speed data to a template.  You can then follow the template when doing a future pull, enabling consistent tasting espresso. 

The downside to such systems is the cost.  An entry level scale like the Acaia Lunar Espresso Scale is $250, and the pressure gauge is $460 from naked-portafilter (both pictured below).

Our goal is to create a sub $120 open-source version of this system, lowering the entry cost to hobbyists and enabling more consistent cups of quality espresso.
